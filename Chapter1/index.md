# [Getting Started with DDD](#_bookmark0)

*Design is not just what it looks like and feels like\.*

*Design is how it works\.*

*—Steve Jobs*

We strive to produce quality in the software we develop\. We achieve some qual\- ity by using tests to help us avoid delivering software with a fatal number of bugs\. Yet, even if we could produce completely bug\-free software, that in itself does not necessarily mean that a quality software model is designed\. The soft\- ware model—the *way *the software expresses the solution to the business goal being sought—could still suffer greatly\. Delivering software with few defects is obviously good\. Still, we can reach higher for a well\-designed software model that explicitly reflects the intended business objective, and our work may even reach the level of *great*\.

The software development approach called *Domain\-Driven Design*, or *DDD*, exists to help us more readily succeed at achieving high\-quality software model designs\. When implemented correctly, DDD helps us reach the point where *our design is exactly how the software works*\. This book is about help\- ing you correctly implement DDD\.

You may be completely new to DDD, you may have tried it and struggled, or you may have already succeeded with it before\. Regardless, you no doubt are reading this book because you want to improve your ability to implement DDD, and you can\. The chapter road map helps you target your specific needs\.

__Road Map to This Chapter__

- Discover what DDD can do for your projects and your teams as you grapple with complexity\.
- Find out how to score your project to see if it deserves the DDD investment\.
- Consider the common alternatives to DDD and why they often lead to problems\.
- Grasp the foundations of DDD as you learn how to take the first steps on your project\.
- Learn how to sell DDD to your management, domain experts, and technical team members\.   
- Face the challenges of using DDD armed with knowledge of how to succeed\.
- Look in on a team that is learning how to implement DDD\.  

What should you expect from DDD? Not a heavy, dense, ceremonial process that blocks your way to progress\. Rather, expect to use the agile development techniques you probably already have come to trust\. Beyond agile, anticipate the acquisition of methods that help you gain deep insight into your business domain, with the prospect of producing testable, malleable, organized, care\- fully crafted, high\-quality software models\.

DDD gives you both the *strategic and tactical modeling tools *necessary to design high\-quality software that meets core business objectives\.
